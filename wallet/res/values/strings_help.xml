		<p>
			This option allows you to import a private key.
		</p>
		<p>
			This can be used to redeem a Paper Wallet or import a Vanity Address.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can create a Paper Wallet (Cold Storage) at <b>Preminer.com</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Enter the Private Key you want to import,
			or touch the camera icon to scan a QR Code.
			Then, select the option \'Import\'.
		</p>
		<p>
		    <b>Warning</b>
		    Importing a Private Key requires resetting and reloading the Block Chain.<br/>
		    This takes several minutes. You won\'t be able to use the Wallet during that time.
		</p>
		<p>
		    You can only import private keys in <b>WIF format</b>
		    (51 base58 characters, starts with a \'5\')
		    or BIP38-encrypted WIF keys.

		<p>
			Using this dialog, you can request coins from another person (who should already have installed Premine Wallet).
		</p>
		<p>
			First, you can enter an amount of Premines to request.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, you either have the generated QR code scanned by the other person.
			Or, you can send your request to a remote person with the share button in the action bar.
			The other person will have to click the Premine URL.
		</p>
		<p>
			Either way, the other person will be presented a dialog for sending coins with all fields pre-populated.
			If she accepts, all she needs to do is sending the payment.

			You have initiated the process of sending coins.
			You came here either through the main screen or by clicking on a Premine URL in your mobile browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, you enter the Premine address to pay to.
			The address will autocomplete from known entries in your address book.
			You can also scan QR codes with Premine addresses or Premine requests by pressing the QR button in the action bar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, you can see how many Premines you can spend at the moment.
			Any difference to the balance from the main screen is still unconfirmed and can thus not yet be spent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Last, you enter the amount to pay.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can enter a payment while being offline.
			It will be sent on next restart of Premine Wallet.

			Note:
			Payments are irreversible!
			Always check the receiving address.

			<b>Important safety notes:</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Premines are stored on the device.
			<b>If you lose it, you\'ll lose your Premines.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			This means you need to <b>back up your wallet</b>!
			Use the in-app backup facility for this, rather than a third party backup app.
			Keep your backup safe and remember the password.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Before uninstalling</b> (or clearing app data/wiping your device), <b>transfer your Premines to another wallet</b>.
			Remaining Premines will be lost.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Payments are irreversible</b>.
			If you send your Premines into the void, there is almost no way to get them back.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Keep your mobile device safe!</b>
			Do not root your device.
			Do only install apps you fully trust.
			Malicious apps could be trying to steal your wallet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Keep the risk low!
			<b>Only use with small amounts</b> for day use.
		</p>
